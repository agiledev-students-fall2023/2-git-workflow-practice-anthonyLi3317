[**How to Use AI to Improve Code Quality**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-ai-to-improve-code-quality/)

One of the intriguing points the article touches upon is the role of AI in enhancing documentation quality. With AI's assistance, developers can produce more comprehensive and accurate documentation. The author even mentions incorporating AI-generated icons and custom images to make the documentation more appealing. Another noteworthy mention is the author's personal experience with remote work. In the era of remote working, AI has proven invaluable in ensuring developers stay updated with their tasks. The article emphasizes the myriad ways AI can boost productivity. The overarching message is clear: while AI can be a powerful tool to augment coding practices, it should not replace the human touch. Instead, developers should leverage AI to enhance their skills and workflows. I find this article particularly interesting because it highlights the potential of AI in areas of software development that are often overlooked, such as documentation. The emphasis on using AI as a tool to complement human skills, rather than replace them, is a crucial takeaway for the future of software engineering.

### Bocheng Dai's Comment
The author of this article outlines six key tactics for improving the quality of software developers' code that they have personally found to be effective. These include using AI for idea generation, code reviews, code completion, bug detection, performance optimization, and creating AI-driven documentation. They stress that even while AI tools can be a big help in coding by making ideas and spotting errors early on, it is crucial for the developer to maintain control and not completely rely on AI for coding tasks.
